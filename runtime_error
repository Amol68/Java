/* Run Time errors occur or we can say, are detected during the execution of the program.

Sometimes these are discovered when the user enters an invalid data or data which is not relevant. 

Runtime errors occur when a program does not contain any syntax errors but asks the computer to do 
something that the computer is unable to reliably do. 

During compilation, the compiler has no technique 
to detect these kinds of errors. It is the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that detects it while the program
is running. 

To handle the error during the run time we can put our error code inside the try block and 
catch the error inside the catch block. */
